This Extension is just shoiwing a User INterface where we will greet the user with starter Message, and then ask User to enter the Prompt for which they need reply. Then we go to the APIs and fetch the Response from AI services and display it to the user. For now, We are showing only the DUmmy Data here, since implementation of APIs would need some more time and more knowledge of AI models to be implemented.
